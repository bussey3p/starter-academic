I am a PhD student in the [School of Criminal Justice](https://cech.uc.edu/schools/criminaljustice.html) at the University of Cincinnati. I work as a graduate research assistant in the [Institute of Crime Science](https://cech.uc.edu/about/centers/ics.html). My research centers on policing with emphases on crime and place, public opinion, and police shootings. Welcome to my personal website.
