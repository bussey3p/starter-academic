Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD student in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha. I work as a graduate research assistant in the Violence Intervention and Policing Research (VIPR) Lab. My research centers on policing with emphases on officer use of force, evidence-based policing strategies, and crime science. I am also a trained crime analyst and work to develop proactive crime reduction strategies for law enforcement agencies. Contact me if you have any questions!
